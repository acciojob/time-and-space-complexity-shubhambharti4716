	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that
		measures the efficiency of an algorithm.
		It analyzes the amount of time an algorithm
		takes to complete as a function of the input size. 
		Efficient algorithms aim to minimize
		the time complexity, ensuring that they can process
		large inputs quickly and effectively.
	</p>
	<p>Space complexity, on the other hand,
		focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses during 
		its execution. It evaluates how the memory usage
		increases with the input size. An important notation used to
		represent space complexity is 'O(n)', where 'n' represents the
		size of the input. This notation helps us understand how
		an algorithm's memory requirements scale with the problem
		size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration 
		when designing algorithms to ensure optimal memory utilization.</p>
