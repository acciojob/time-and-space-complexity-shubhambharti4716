    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It analyzes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize the time complexity, ensuring that they can process large inputs quickly and effectively.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses during its execution. It evaluates how the memory usage increases with the input size. An important notation used to represent space complexity is <b>'O(n)'</b>, where <b>'n'</b> represents the size of the input. This notation helps us understand how an algorithm's memory requirements scale with the problem size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration when designing algorithms to ensure optimal memory utilization.
